This repository stores the script(s) used to calculate the dNdS ratios in MAST-4 genes for the preprint of Latorre F., "Global population structure of a unicellular marine predator."

The script `dNdS.py ' is a Python script tailored to this research's needs. It works when analyzing the exact same number of samples (82 metaG) and gff format. However, the script must be changed for use in other settings.
